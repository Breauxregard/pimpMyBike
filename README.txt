HT1632 - Adafruit library for the 16x24 LED Matrix Panel. I added several functions (translate() is one example) to make it easy to scroll text and/or images. At some point I'm going to do a pull request on the LED driver's github repo. I'm also going to create a video demoing some of the functions. Until then, feel free to take a peak at the files if you're curious. http://www.adafruit.com/products/555

LEDMatrixVisulaizer - A Processing sketch that I wrote to make it easy to design and output LED images/ patterns. The program allows you to turn LEDs on and off as well as draw LED lines, circles, and squares (all shapes can be filled or unfilled). You can save the design to a text file and/or import previous designs. You can also print out the values of each LED in the matrix, which is useful if you'd like to use an array of LED matrix values in Arduino sketches (like the pimpMyBike sketch).

exercises - mostly incomplete. Originally intended for use in the Pimp My Bike Skillshare class, but I didn't flesh out the examples. Perhaps I will do that at a later date.

pimpMyBike - main Arduino sketch for the bike circuit containing LED turn indicators, brake light, speedometer, and odometer.

reedSwitch - sketch I wrote to test the reedSwitch.
