bike.fzz - 
Fritzing diagram of the bike circuit

exercises - 
mostly incomplete. Originally intended for use in the pimpMyBike Skillshare class, but I didn't flesh out the examples. Perhaps I will do that at a later date.

LEDMatrixVisulaizer - 
A Processing sketch that I wrote to make it easy to design and output LED images/ patterns. The program allows you to turn LEDs on and off as well as draw LED lines, circles, and squares (all shapes can be filled or unfilled). You can save the design to a text file and/or import previous designs. You can also print out the values of each LED in the matrix, which is useful if you'd like to use an array of LED matrix values in Arduino sketches (like the pimpMyBike sketch).

pimpMyBike - 
main Arduino sketch for the bike circuit containing LED turn indicators, brake light, speedometer, and odometer.
